# capstone_project
This repository contains the notebook of my final project for the General Assemblyâ€™s Data Science Immersive course.

---

Drivvo is a mobile app to record and keep track of vehicle expenses and keep on top of regular maintenance. The app has more than 2 million registered vehicles and users from more than 180 countries. Currently the app's main function is to create reports on the vehicle services and expenses based on the users inputs. 

The main objective of this project was to add value to the app by predicting when the vehicle would  need its next oil change using regression models.

More detailed information on the project and its processes can be found on the summary description and capstone presentation.
